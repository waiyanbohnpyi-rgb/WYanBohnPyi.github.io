    <p>Ankylosaurus is a genus of heavily armored dinosaur whose fossils have been found in geological formations dating to the very end of the Cretaceous Period, approximately 68–66 million years ago. These discoveries come from western North America, making Ankylosaurus one of the last known non-avian dinosaurs.</p>
    <p>The genus was named by Barnum Brown in 1908 and is monotypic, containing only one recognized species: Ankylosaurus magniventris. The name Ankylosaurus means fused or bent lizard, while the species name translates to "great belly".</p>
    <p>Although several specimens have been excavated, a fully complete skeleton has not yet been discovered. Even so, Ankylosaurus is often considered the archetypal member of its group due to its distinctive body armor and tail club, despite possessing some unusual anatomical features.</p>
